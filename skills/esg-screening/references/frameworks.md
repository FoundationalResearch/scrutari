# ESG Reporting Frameworks

## SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board)

**Focus**: Financially material ESG factors by industry

- 77 industry-specific standards
- Identifies material topics and metrics for each industry
- Designed for investor decision-making
- Now part of IFRS Foundation (ISSB)

**Key Features:**
- Industry-specific (e.g., different standards for Software vs Oil & Gas)
- Quantitative metrics where possible
- Focused on enterprise value impact

**Example — Technology & Communications:**
- Environmental footprint of hardware infrastructure
- Data privacy and freedom of expression
- Data security
- Recruiting and managing a global workforce
- IP protection and competitive behavior

## TCFD (Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures)

**Focus**: Climate risk and opportunity disclosure

**Four Pillars:**

| Pillar | Key Disclosures |
|--------|----------------|
| Governance | Board oversight, management's role in climate |
| Strategy | Climate risks/opportunities, scenario analysis |
| Risk Management | How climate risks are identified and managed |
| Metrics & Targets | GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2, 3), climate targets |

**Scenario Analysis:**
- Well below 2°C scenario (Paris-aligned)
- 2°C scenario
- 4°C+ scenario (business as usual)

**Risk Categories:**
- Transition risks: Policy, technology, market, reputation
- Physical risks: Acute (extreme weather), chronic (sea level rise)

## GRI (Global Reporting Initiative)

**Focus**: Comprehensive sustainability reporting for all stakeholders

- Universal standards (applicable to all organizations)
- Sector standards (industry-specific)
- Topic standards (specific ESG issues)

**Key Principles:**
- Materiality (double materiality — impact on company AND company's impact on world)
- Stakeholder inclusiveness
- Completeness
- Balance (positive and negative aspects)

## UN SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)

**17 Goals:**

| # | Goal | Investment Relevance |
|---|------|---------------------|
| 1 | No Poverty | Microfinance, financial inclusion |
| 2 | Zero Hunger | Agriculture, food tech |
| 3 | Good Health | Healthcare, pharma, wellness |
| 4 | Quality Education | EdTech, workforce development |
| 5 | Gender Equality | Diversity metrics, pay equity |
| 6 | Clean Water | Water utilities, treatment tech |
| 7 | Affordable Energy | Renewables, energy storage |
| 8 | Decent Work | Labor standards, supply chain |
| 9 | Industry & Innovation | Infrastructure, R&D |
| 10 | Reduced Inequalities | Financial inclusion, access |
| 11 | Sustainable Cities | Smart cities, green buildings |
| 12 | Responsible Consumption | Circular economy, waste |
| 13 | Climate Action | Emissions reduction, adaptation |
| 14 | Life Below Water | Ocean health, sustainable fishing |
| 15 | Life on Land | Biodiversity, deforestation |
| 16 | Peace & Justice | Anti-corruption, governance |
| 17 | Partnerships | Public-private collaboration |

## ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board)

**Focus**: Global baseline for sustainability disclosures

- IFRS S1: General sustainability disclosure requirements
- IFRS S2: Climate-related disclosures (builds on TCFD)
- Consolidates SASB and TCFD into a single global standard
- Mandatory in many jurisdictions starting 2024-2025

## EU Taxonomy

**Focus**: Classification system for environmentally sustainable activities

**Six Environmental Objectives:**
1. Climate change mitigation
2. Climate change adaptation
3. Sustainable use of water
4. Transition to circular economy
5. Pollution prevention
6. Biodiversity protection

**Activity must:**
- Substantially contribute to at least one objective
- Do no significant harm (DNSH) to other objectives
- Comply with minimum social safeguards
